<Aside type="caution" title="This will block your client">
  Running this simulation will trigger Arcjet Shield and block your client for
  15 minutes. The ability to configure this threshold and manage blocked clients
  is coming soon.

```sh
curl -v -H "x-arcjet-suspicious: true" http://localhost:5173
```

The default response for a blocked request is a 403 Forbidden which you will see
when you make the 6th request:

```sh
# ...5 requests made previously
curl -v -H "x-arcjet-suspicious: true" http://localhost:5173
...
> GET / HTTP/2
> Host: localhost:5173
> User-Agent: curl/8.4.0
